👁️ Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System
                                                                            
  An AI-powered web application for automated detection and severity classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus images using Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques.

📌 Project Overview
  Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a serious eye disease caused by diabetes and can lead to blindness if not detected early.
  This project aims to assist ophthalmologists and medical professionals by providing an automated screening tool that analyzes retinal images and predicts the severity stage (0–4) of Diabetic Retinopathy.

  The system uses:
      •	EfficientNetB0 for deep feature extraction
      •	Random Forest Classifier for DR stage prediction
      •	Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly web interface
